# Homies

A simple ASP.NET MVC project for managing events. Only logged in users can see the events. Users can create events and join other user's events. Only the creators of the events can edit them. Users who have joined an event can leave it. All users can see all events and the events they have joined. 

It is made as an exercise for the ASP.NET Fundamentals course in SoftUni.
